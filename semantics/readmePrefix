The definition of the CakeML language. The definition is (mostly) expressed in
[Lem](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/lem), but the generated HOL is included.
The directory includes definitions of:
 - the concrete syntax,
 - the abstract syntax,
 - big step semantics (both functional and relational),
 - a small step semantics,
 - the semantics of FFI calls, and,
 - the type system.

The Lem version used: rems-project/lem@194778e97d1e9a41ebbe34a8e4d5fb2d10395ba7
