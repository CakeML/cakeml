The definition of the CakeML language. The definition is (mostly)
expressed in [Lem](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~sao/lem), but the
generated HOL is also included. The directory includes definitions of:
 - the concrete syntax
 - the abstract syntax
 - small step semantics
 - big step semantics (both functional and relational)
 - semantics of FFI calls
 - a type system
