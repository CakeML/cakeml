The definition of the CakeML language. The definition is (mostly)
expressed in [Lem](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~sao/lem), but the
generated HOL is also included. The directory includes definitions of:
 - the concrete syntax,
 - the abstract syntax,
 - big step semantics (both functional and relational),
 - a small step semantics,
 - the semantics of FFI calls, and
 - the type system.
