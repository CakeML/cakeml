Alternative definitions of the semantics:
  - using inductive relations (as opposed to functional big-step style), and,
  - as a small-step relation.

[bigStep.lem](bigStep.lem):
A clocked relational big-step semantics for CakeML. This semantics
is no longer used in the CakeML development.

[proofs](proofs):
The direcory contains proofs about the old relational semantics for
CakeML. This directory might be deleted in the future.

[smallStep.lem](smallStep.lem):
A small-step semantics for CakeML. This semantics is no longer used
in the CakeML development.
