Alternative definitions of the semantics:
  - using inductive relations (as opposed to functional big-step style), and,
  - as a small-step relation.

[bigStepScript.sml](bigStepScript.sml):
A clocked relational big-step semantics for CakeML. This semantics
is no longer used in the CakeML development.

[itree_semanticsScript.sml](itree_semanticsScript.sml):
An itree-based semantics for CakeML

[proofs](proofs):
The direcory contains proofs about the old relational semantics for
CakeML. This directory might be deleted in the future.

[smallStepScript.sml](smallStepScript.sml):
A small-step semantics for CakeML. This semantics is no longer used
in the main CakeML development, but is used in PureCake and choreographies.
