The definition of the CakeML language. The definition is (mostly)
expressed in [Lem](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/~sao/lem), but the
generated HOL is also included. The directory includes definitions of:
 - the concrete syntax
 - the abstract syntax
 - small step semantics
 - big step semantics (both functional and relational)
 - semantics of FFI calls
 - a type system

[addancs.sml](addancs.sml):
A script to add a set_grammar_ancestry line to a generated Script.sml file.

[alt_semantics](alt_semantics):
Alternative definitions of the semantics:
  - using inductive relations (as opposed to functional big-step style), and,
  - as a small-step relation.

[ast.lem](ast.lem):
Definition of CakeML abstract syntax (AST).

[astPP.sml](astPP.sml):
Pretty printing for CakeML AST

[astSyntax.sml](astSyntax.sml):
ML functions for manipulating HOL terms and types defined as part of the
CakeML semantics, in particular CakeML abstract syntax.

[cmlPtreeConversionScript.sml](cmlPtreeConversionScript.sml):
Specification of how to convert parse trees to abstract syntax.

[evaluate.lem](evaluate.lem):
Functional big-step semantics for evaluation of CakeML programs.

[ffi](ffi):
Definition of CakeML's observational semantics, in particular traces of calls
over the Foreign-Function Interface (FFI).

[fpSem.lem](fpSem.lem):
Definitions of the floating point operations used in CakeML.

[gramScript.sml](gramScript.sml):
Definition of CakeML's Context-Free Grammar.
The grammar specifies how token lists should be converted to syntax trees.

[grammar.txt](grammar.txt):
V ::= "op" ID | ID

[lexer_funScript.sml](lexer_funScript.sml):
A functional specification of lexing from strings to token lists.

[namespace.lem](namespace.lem):
TODO: document

[namespacePropsScript.sml](namespacePropsScript.sml):
Proofs about the namespace datatype.
TODO: move to proofs directory?

[primTypes.lem](primTypes.lem):
Definition of the primitive types that are in scope before any CakeML program
starts. Some of them are generated by running an initial program.

[proofs](proofs):
Theorems about CakeML's syntax and semantics.

[semanticPrimitives.lem](semanticPrimitives.lem):
Definitions of semantic primitives (e.g., values, and functions for doing
primitive operations) used in the semantics.

[semanticPrimitivesSyntax.sml](semanticPrimitivesSyntax.sml):
ML functions for manipulating the HOL terms and types defined in
semanticPrimitivesTheory.

[semanticsComputeLib.sml](semanticsComputeLib.sml):
compset for parts of the semantics, including the lexer.

[semanticsLib.sml](semanticsLib.sml):
TODO: move

[semanticsScript.sml](semanticsScript.sml):
The top-level semantics of CakeML programs.

[terminationScript.sml](terminationScript.sml):
Termination proofs for functions defined in .lem files whose termination is
not proved automatically.

[tokenUtilsScript.sml](tokenUtilsScript.sml):
Utility functions over tokens.
TODO: perhaps should just appear in tokensTheory.

[tokens.lem](tokens.lem):
The tokens of CakeML concrete syntax.
Some tokens are from Standard ML and not used in CakeML.

[typeSystem.lem](typeSystem.lem):
Specification of CakeML's type system.
