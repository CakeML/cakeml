evaluate_repl_decsScript.sml
   Prove properties about evaluation (in the operational semantics) of the REPL
   module, and of making a call to call_repl_step.
   Also, define the calls to the compiler that are to be evaluated.

compile_repl_decsScript.sml
  Evaluate the compiler on the REPL module.
  Takes around 30 minutes to complete.
  Also, a few other bits of evaluation:
    - the compiler on the bit of code required to call repl_step,
    - prove that the above has no labels, and
    - the free variables of the REPL module.

bootstrap_lemmasScript.sml
  Define the invariant on the bytecode state that includes the bootstrapped
  compiler. Prove that this invariant holds after jumping to the code to call
  repl_step with a new value in the input reference. Also prove that the code
  will run and leave the value of repl_step applied to the input in the
  output reference and the invariant will hold again.
