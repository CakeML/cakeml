Semantics, soundness, and consistency for the HOL inference system.

[holAxiomsScript.sml](holAxiomsScript.sml):
Prove consistency of each of the axioms. (For the axiom of infinity, this
requires an additional assumption on the set theory.)

[holBoolScript.sml](holBoolScript.sml):
Define semantics for the Boolean operations and show the definitions are
correct.

[holConsistencyScript.sml](holConsistencyScript.sml):
Proves consistency of the inference system: starting from any context with a
model, any context reached by non-axiomatic extensions has both provable and
unprovable sequents. And the base case: the HOL contexts (initial context
with no axioms, with all but infinity axiom, with all three axioms) have
models (under suitable assumptions).

[holExtensionScript.sml](holExtensionScript.sml):
Proves soundness of the context extension rules: any model of a context can
be extended to a model of the context obtained by applying one of the
non-axiomatic context updates.

[holSemanticsExtraScript.sml](holSemanticsExtraScript.sml):
Some lemmas about the semantics.

[holSemanticsScript.sml](holSemanticsScript.sml):
Define semantics for HOL sequents, in particular the notion of entailment
i.e. valid sequents, which are those that satisfied by any model of the
theory context.

[holSoundnessScript.sml](holSoundnessScript.sml):
Proves soundness of the inference system: any provable sequent is valid.
