Implementation of the monadic functions in (deeply embedded) CakeML,
generated by the translator (proof-producing synthesis).

[lisp](lisp):
Parsing and pretty printing of simple s-expressions

[ml_hol_initScript.sml](ml_hol_initScript.sml):
Prove that the state of the kernel can be initialised in a way that
meets the invariants (STATE and HOL_STORE).

[ml_hol_kernelProgScript.sml](ml_hol_kernelProgScript.sml):
Close the kernel module from ml_hol_kernel_funsProg

[ml_hol_kernel_funsProgScript.sml](ml_hol_kernel_funsProgScript.sml):
Apply the monadic translator to the Candle kernel to generate the
deeply embedded CakeML code for the kernel. As a side effect, the
monadic translator proves certificate theorems that state a formal
connection between the generated code and the input HOL functions.

[ppKernelScript.sml](ppKernelScript.sml):
Pretty prints the CakeML code of the Candle kernel.
The output is produced in a file called kernel_ml.txt.

[print_thmScript.sml](print_thmScript.sml):
Defines functions for turning a ctxt & thm to a string and back

[runtime_checkLib.sml](runtime_checkLib.sml):
Mechanism for adding runtime type checking annotations, used in the Candle
prover soundness proofs.

[runtime_checkScript.sml](runtime_checkScript.sml):
Theorems and definitions to support adding runtime type checking annotations.
