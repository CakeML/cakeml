Definition of the inference system for HOL, including semantics in set theory
and proofs of soundness and consistency.

[ml_kernel](ml_kernel):
Implementation of the monadic functions in (deeply embedded) CakeML,
generated by the translator (proof-producing synthesis).

[monadic](monadic):
Implementation of the Candle kernel as monadic functions in HOL (i.e. a
shallow embedding), and proof that they refine the HOL inference system.

[opentheory](opentheory):
Implementation of an OpenTheory reader based on the Candle kernel.

[semantics](semantics):
Semantics, soundness, and consistency for the HOL inference system.

[syntax](syntax):
Syntax of the HOL inference system.
