- Finish proving the top-level theorem in candle_prover_semantics
  + Finish proving that the candle_init_env environment is env_ok
  + Prove that the basis program does not write to kernel FFI
  + Finish the divergence-part
  + Prove that all refs in the basis state are ref_ok
- Get the Candle kernel to write out all context updates to a special FFI.
  Maybe we can get the translator to do this automatically, instead of storing
  it, with a custom store predicate?
- Use the monadic translator on the OCaml parser parse-tree conversion:
  we can use the local-refs mode to make it into a pure function. Hopefully
  this will speed it up.
- Get format.sml parsed into CakeML declarations so that we can put it in basis.
