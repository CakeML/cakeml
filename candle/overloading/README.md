Definition of the inference system for HOL with ad-hoc overloading,
including semantics in set theory and proofs of soundness and
consistency.

[ml_checker](ml_checker):
Implementation of an I/O shim for extracting a cyclicity checker
binary.

[ml_kernel](ml_kernel):
Implementation of the monadic functions in (deeply embedded) CakeML,
generated by the translator (proof-producing synthesis).

[monadic](monadic):
Implementation of the Candle kernel as monadic functions in HOL (i.e. a
shallow embedding), and proof that they refine the HOL inference system.

[semantics](semantics):
Semantics, soundness, and consistency for the HOL inference system
with ad-hoc overloading of constant definitions.

[syntax](syntax):
Syntax of the HOL inference system with ad-hoc overloading.
