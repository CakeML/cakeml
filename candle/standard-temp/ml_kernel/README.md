Implementation of the monadic functions in (deeply embedded) CakeML,
generated by the translator (proof-producing synthesis).

[ml_hol_initScript.sml](ml_hol_initScript.sml):
Prove that the state of the kernel can be initialised in a way that
meets the invariants (STATE and HOL_STORE).

[ml_hol_kernelProgScript.sml](ml_hol_kernelProgScript.sml):
Apply the monadic translator to the Candle kernel to generate the
deeply embedded CakeML code for the kernel. As a side effect, the
monadic translator proves certificate theorems that state a formal
connection between the generated code and the input HOL functions.

[ppKernelScript.sml](ppKernelScript.sml):
Pretty prints the CakeML code of the Candle kernel.
The output is produced in a file called kernel_ml.txt.
