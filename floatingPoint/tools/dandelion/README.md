# Dandelion

A certificate checker for approximations of elementary functions.

## Building Dandelion

Dandelion relies on a copy of sollya (sollya.org). Therefore it is
necessary to run `Holmake` in this directory to execute the code
in `.hol_preexec`.

## Key theorems and definitions relating to the original ITP'22 paper

The first phase is defined across the files `transcApproxSemScript.sml` and
`approxPolyScript.sml`. The first file defines the overall approximation
function `approxAsPoly` and gives its soundness proof, and
`approxPolyScript.sml` defines the low-level approximation function for
approximating a single elementary function with a single polynomial and proves
soundness of this function.

Theorem 4 (First Phase Soundness) from section 3 is proven in file
`transcApproxSemScript.sml` as `approxTransc_sound`.
Variants of Theorem 5 are proven for the supported elementary function in file
`mcLaurinApproxScript.sml` if they are not provided by HOL4.
Variants of Theorem 6 are proven for the supported elementary functions in file
`approxPolyScript.sml`.

The second phase is implemented and proven sound in the file
`checkerScript.sml`.
It relies on the implementation of computable Sturm sequences in
`sturmComputeScript.sml` and computable polynomial division in
`euclidDivScript.sml`.

Theorem 7 (Second Phase Soundness) from section 4 is proven in file
`checkerScript.sml` as the combination of `numZeros_sound`,
`validBounds_is_valid`, and `validateZerosLeqErr_sound`.

Theorem 8 was ported from Harrison's HOL-Light proofs in file `drangScript.sml`
and is called `BOUND_THEOREM_INEXACT`.

Theorem 9 (Dandelion soundness) is called `checker_soundness` in file
`checkerScript.sml`.

The extracted binary is created in the directory `binary`.
File `translateScript.sml` sets up the CakeML translation of the definitions of
Dandelion, file `certParserScript.sml` defines our (unverified) parser and
lexer, file `sturmMainCakeScript.sml` proves the CakeML specification for the
binary, and file `sturmMainCakeCompileScript.sml` compiles the binary for the
second phase by running the CakeML compiler in-logic on the translated
definitions.
