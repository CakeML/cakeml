Prove end-to-end correctness theorem for PB checker with arrays

[npbc_fullProofARM8Script.sml](npbc_fullProofARM8Script.sml):
Compose the semantics theorem and the compiler correctness
theorem with the compiler evaluation theorem to produce end-to-end
correctness theorem that reaches final machine code.
