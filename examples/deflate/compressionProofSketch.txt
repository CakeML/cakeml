To prove:

dictionary:

[0] the dictionary has all base characters

[1] the ditionary has a match/prefix all strings
 -  needs: [0]

[2] all strings can be formulated as a list of keys from the dictionary
 -  needs: [1]

[3] no code is a prefix to another

[4] keys are sorted by descending length to avoid clashes i.e. "anan" will always be chosen before "an"
 

tab_sub:
[5] given a list of keys corresponding to a dictionary, there exists only one resulting list of codes 
 - 	needs: [2, 3, 4] 


compresssion:
 - 	needs: [5]

expansion:
 - 	needs: [5]
