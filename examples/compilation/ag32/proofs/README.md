Prove end-to-end correctness theorems for the examples as compiled to
Silver machine code.

[helloProofScript.sml](helloProofScript.sml):
Compose the hello semantics theorem and the compiler correctness
theorem with the compiler evaluation theorem to produce end-to-end
correctness theorem that reaches final machine code.

[sortProofScript.sml](sortProofScript.sml):
Compose the sort semantics theorem and the compiler correctness
theorem with the compiler evaluation theorem to produce end-to-end
correctness theorem that reaches final machine code.

[wordcountProofScript.sml](wordcountProofScript.sml):
Compose the wordcount semantics theorem and the compiler correctness
theorem with the compiler evaluation theorem to produce end-to-end
correctness theorem that reaches final machine code.
