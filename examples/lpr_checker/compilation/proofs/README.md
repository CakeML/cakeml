Prove end-to-end correctness theorem for LPR checker

[lprProofScript.sml](lprProofScript.sml):
Compose the LPR semantics theorem and the compiler correctness
theorem with the compiler evaluation theorem to produce end-to-end
correctness theorem that reaches final machine code.

[ramseyProofScript.sml](ramseyProofScript.sml):
Compose the Ramsey semantics theorem and the compiler correctness
theorem with the compiler evaluation theorem to produce end-to-end
correctness theorem that reaches final machine code.
