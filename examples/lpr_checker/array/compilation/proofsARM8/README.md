Prove end-to-end correctness theorem for LPR checker with arrays
against ARM8 model

[lpr_arrayProofARM8Script.sml](lpr_arrayProofARM8Script.sml):
Compose the semantics theorem and the compiler correctness
theorem with the compiler evaluation theorem to produce end-to-end
correctness theorem that reaches final machine code.
