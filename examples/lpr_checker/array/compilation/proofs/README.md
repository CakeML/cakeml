Prove end-to-end correctness theorem for LRAT checker with arrays

[lrat_arrayProofScript.sml](lrat_arrayProofScript.sml):
Compose the LRAT semantics theorem and the compiler correctness
theorem with the compiler evaluation theorem to produce end-to-end
correctness theorem that reaches final machine code.
