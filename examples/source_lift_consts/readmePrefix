Benchmarks for the source-level constant-lifting pass, mostly copied from the
RealCake evaluation

To run the benchmarks, first run Holmake in this directory.
Then extract a bootstrapped version of the compiler with the
Makefile and the FFI into the output directory.

Then open a shell in the output folder and run the script `run_eval.sh`.
The script first compiles the CakeML sexpression files into CakeML binaries, and
runs them on 3 different sets of inputs, computes the average running time and
logs it into a file log.csv.
