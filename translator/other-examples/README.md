A few other examples of HOL functions that can be translated into CakeML.

[auxiliary](auxiliary):
This directory contains definitions used for miscellaneous translator
examples from used in the original ICFP paper about the translator.

[example_91Script.sml](example_91Script.sml):
This is a simple example of applying the translator to
the 91 function.

[example_balanced_bstScript.sml](example_balanced_bstScript.sml):
This is a simple example of applying the translator to
a balanced binary tree from HOL.

[example_copying_gcScript.sml](example_copying_gcScript.sml):
This is a simple example of applying the translator to an
algorithm-level model of a copying garbage collector.

[example_parser_genScript.sml](example_parser_genScript.sml):
This is a simple example of applying the translator to a
parser generator.

[example_primality_testScript.sml](example_primality_testScript.sml):
This is a simple example of applying the translator to an
efficient primaliy tester formalised by Joe Hurd.

[example_qsortScript.sml](example_qsortScript.sml):
This is a simple example of applying the translator to a
functional version of quick sort.

[example_regexp_matcherScript.sml](example_regexp_matcherScript.sml):
This is a simple example of applying the translator to a
matcher for regular expressions.
