  (** Making progress on goals of the form [H1 ==>> H2].

      The main tactic one wants to use faced with such a goal is [hsimpl].

      It will normalize both heaps, extract pure formulæ ([cond]), extract and
      instantiate existential quantifications from H1 and H2, and remove
      subheaps present both in H1 and H2.

      [hsimpl_conseq_conv] fails if the input term is not of the form
      ``_ ==>> _ `` or ``_ ==+> _``. Otherwise, it returns UNCHANGED if there
      is nothing to do.

      [hsimpl] applies [hsimpl_conseq_conv] on every subterm of the goal on
      which it doesn't fail, that is on every [SEP_IMP] and [SEP_IMPPOST].

  (* [hpull_conseq_conv]: extract pure facts and existential quantifications
     from the left heap (H1).

     For example: On term ``(A * cond P) ==>> B``, [hpull_conseq_conv] returns a
     conseq conv to convert it to ``P ==> (A ==>> B)``.

     On term ``(SEP_EXISTS x. A x * B) ==>> C``, the returned conseq_conv
     allows to convert it to ``!x. (A x * B) ==>> C``.

     [hpull_conseq_conv] fails if the goal is not of the form ``_ ==>> _``. If
     the goal is of this form but there is nothing to pull, UNCHANGED is raised.

  (* [hsimpl_cancel_conseq_conv]: on a goal of the form [H1 ==>> H2],
     [hsimpl_cancel_conseq_conv] tries to remove subheaps present both in H1 and

     [hsimpl_cancel] will remove both, and produce an assumption [v = v'].

     For example, [hsimpl_cancel_conseq_conv] generates a conversion from
     ``(A * B * one (l, v)) ==>> (B * one (l, v'))`` to
     ``v = v' ==> (A ==>> emp)``.

     [hsimpl_cancel_conseq_conv] fails if the goal is not of the form

     ``P /\ A ==>> B``.

     [hpullr_conseq_conv] fails if the goal is not of the form
