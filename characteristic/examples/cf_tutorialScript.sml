(* Then, write the code for the programs we want to specify.

   We define first a length function on lists, then the fromList
   function we want to specify (it takes a list of bytes, and returns
   a new bytearray containing those bytes).

(* We can start proving a specification for length.

   The tactic that handles function application in characteristic
   formulae is able to fetch specifications from the assumptions, and
   from the exported theorems of the current theories.
   As we want to use length in fromList, we store its specification.

val list_length_spec = store_thm ("list_length_spec",

(* Toplevel specifications are of the form:
   !x1..xn argv1.. argvm.
     facts_about_xi_argvj x1 .. xn .. argv1 .. argvm ==>
     app (p:'ffi ffi_proj) ^(fetch_v "name" st) [argv1, argv2,...]
       precondition postcondition

   where:

   - [name] is the name of the function in the toplevel declaration we
     added to the ml_prog_state;

   - [st] is the ml_prog_state containing the function;

   - [argv1, ..., argvm] are the arguments of the function, as values
     of the deep embedding;

   - [facts_about_xi_argvj] usually relate the argvi to values of the
     logic, using the predicates defined in ml_translatorTheory,
     and/or contain any necessary logical preconditions;

   - [precondition] is a heap predicate (of type [hprop]), and describe
     the memory heap before the execution of the function.
     The syntax for heap predicates includes:
     - [emp]: the empty heap
     - [H1 * H2]: separating conjunction (H1, H2: hprop)
     - [& P]: a pure fact (P: bool)
     - [H1 ==>> H2]: heap implication (H1, H2: hprop)
     - [REF r v]: a reference cell
     - [ARRAY r lv]: an array

     NB: it is always better to put pure preconditions as logical
     preconditions (in [facts_about_xi_argvj]) than in the
     precondition heap.

   - [postcondition] describes the state of the heap after the
     execution of the function.

     As the function may either return, producing a value, or raise an
     exception, several helper functions are provided for writing
     post-conditions:

     - [POSTv v. Q] is a post-condition that asserts that the function
       will always reduce to a value, here bound to [v], and that the
       heap predicate [Q] (of type [hprop]) must be satisfied;
     - [POSTe v. Q] is similar, but for functions that always raise an
       exception;
     - [POST Qv Qe] is the general case: [Qv] of type [v -> hprop] is
       the post-condition for when the function returns a value, and
       [Qe] (also of type [v -> hprop]) is the post-condition for when
       the function raises an exception.
