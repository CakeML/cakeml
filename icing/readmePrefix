Main implementation directory for PrincessCake(ML): Verified Compilation and
Optimization of Floating-Point Programs
===========================================================================

The development is known to compile with HOL4 commit:
  52ffdc8f01c5cf044427bf6f3a12e8300e91765a

Running the files in this directory requires a working version of
[FloVer](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/AVA/FloVer).
You need to download FloVer, compile its HOL4 development and store its
directory as a shell variable:

```
git clone  https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/AVA/FloVer FloVer
export FLOVERDIR=<current directory>/FloVer/
cd FloVer/hol4/ && $HOLDIR/bin/Holmake
```

Afterwards the content in the directory can be build with `Holmake`.
