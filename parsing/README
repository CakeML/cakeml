# Notes on Verified Parsing for CakeML.

The parsing function that actually runs in the CakeML system should conform to the specification, which is the grammar in `semantics/gram`.  Here conforming means that if a sequence of tokens has a parse tree in the grammar, then the function should return that parse tree (*completeness*).  Dually, if the function returns a parse tree, it should be correct according to the grammar (*soundness*).

The parsing function is one that executes a *Parsing Expression Grammar* (or PEG). PEGs provide an LL-like attack on input strings, but add the ability to do significant back-tracking if necessary.  The CakeML PEG is specified in the file mmlPEGScript.sml.  The same file includes a proof that the PEG is well-formed, which means that execution will always terminate (*totality*).  As PEG execution really is a function (`peg_exec` to be precise), we also have that execution is *deterministic*.   (The necessary background theory of PEGs is in the main HOL distribution.)

## MANIFEST

* `conversionProps`: theory intended to contain properties of the parse-tree conversion functions in `semantics/cmlPtreeConversion`

* `gramProps`: theory containing properties of the governing CFG.  In particular, a slew of nullability results for various non-terminals.

* `lexer_impl`: code for consuming tokens until a top-level semicolon is found (semicolons can be hidden in `let`-`in`-`end` blocks and between parentheses.

* `mmlPEG`: theory defining the PEG for CakeML.  Includes a proof that the PEG is well-formed.

* `mmlParse`: theory defining the overall parsing functions that go from tokens to abstract syntax trees.  (In other words, these include calls to the functions in `semantics/cmlPtreeConversion`.)  The function used in the REPL is `mmlParseREPLTop`.

* `parsingPreamble`: custom HOL proof code

* `pegComplete`: proof of completeness

* `pegSound`: proof of soundness
