This directory contains scripts that compile the CakeML compiler
inside the logic to produce the verified machine code version of the
64-bit compiler.

[basis_ffi.c](basis_ffi.c):
Implements the foreign function interface (FFI) used in the CakeML basis
library, as a thin wrapper around the relevant system calls.

[proofs](proofs):
This directory contains the end-to-end correctness theorem for the
64-bit version of the CakeML compiler.

[test-hello.cml](test-hello.cml):
A hello world program used for testing that the bootstrapped
compiler was built succesfully.

[to_dataBootstrapScript.sml](to_dataBootstrapScript.sml):
Evaluate the 32-bit version of the compiler down to a DataLang
program.

[to_lab_x64BootstrapScript.sml](to_lab_x64BootstrapScript.sml):
Evaluate the 64-bit version of the compiler down to a LabLang
program (an assembly program).

[x64BootstrapScript.sml](x64BootstrapScript.sml):
Evaluate the final part of the 64-bit version of the compiler
into machine code for x64.
