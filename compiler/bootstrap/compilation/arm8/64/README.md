This directory contains scripts that compile the CakeML compiler
inside the logic to produce the verified machine code version of the
64-bit compiler.

[arm8BootstrapScript.sml](arm8BootstrapScript.sml):
Evaluateof the 64-bit version of the compiler into arm8 machine code.

[basis_ffi.c](basis_ffi.c):
Implements the foreign function interface (FFI) used in the CakeML basis
library, as a thin wrapper around the relevant system calls.

[hello.cml](hello.cml):
A simple hello world program in CakeML

[proofs](proofs):
This directory contains the end-to-end correctness theorem for the
64-bit version of the CakeML compiler.
