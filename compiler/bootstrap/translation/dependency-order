(*
This file records the current, linear dependency order between the
translations for the bootstrapped compiler.

This unnatural linear dependency graph is required by the concrete mode
translator (which provides only translation_extends as a method for joining two
translations). Eventually, when we have an abstract mode translator, the
different modules can be made more independent and different combinations can
be selected than simple prefixes of the current ordering.
