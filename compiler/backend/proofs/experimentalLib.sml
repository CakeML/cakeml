(* a family of tools for instantiating forall quantifiers.

   the simplest interface is qsubterm_then: given a pattern, instantiate
   a theorem by finding a subterm of the theorem that matches the pattern,
   and a subterm of the goal or an assumption, and instantiating based on
   those subterms.
