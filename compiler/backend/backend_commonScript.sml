(* An "orphan" expression is one that originates directly from a declaration.
* This happens in source_to_mod, and in con_to_dec. It is an orphan because
* declarations don't come annotated with their source program locations right
* now point (but they might in the future).
* This is a trace that can be used as a basis for traces for orphan expressions.
* It's structure guarantees it will not conflict with any trace originating from
* source, since the always start with four Cons, indicating source position. *)
