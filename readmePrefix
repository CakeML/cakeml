The CakeML project: https://cakeml.org
======================================

CakeML is a verified implementation of a significant subset of
Standard ML.

The source and proofs for CakeML are developed in the [HOL4 theorem
prover](http://hol-theorem-prover.org). We use the latest development
version of [HOL4](https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL), which we
build on [PolyML 5.7](http://www.polyml.org).
Example build instructions can be found in
[build-instructions.sh](build-instructions.sh).

The [master](../../tree/master) branch contains the latest development
version of CakeML. See the [version2](../../tree/version2) or
[version1](../../tree/version1) branch for previous versions.
